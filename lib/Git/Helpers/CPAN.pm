# ABSTRACT: Get repository information for a CPAN module or release

=pod

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $by_module = Git::Helpers::CPAN->new( name => 'Git::Helpers' );
    print $by_module->repository->{web};

    my $by_release = Git::Helpers::CPAN->new( name => 'Git::Helpers' );
    print $by_release->repository->{web};

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS

=head2 name

Can be either the name of a CPAN module or a CPAN release.  In the case of this
module, you could either search for C<Git::Helpers> or C<Git-Helpers>.  For
other modules, keep in mind that the release name may not map well to the
module name.   For example C<LWP::UserAgent> and C<libwww-perl>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 release_name

Returns a C<string> which is the actual release name the search is performed
on.  Mostly helpful for debugging.  It will match your original C<name> arg
except when you've provided a module name.  In that case this will return the
name of the release which the module maps to.

=head2 repository

Returns a C<HashRef> of repository information.  It might return something like:

    {
        type => 'git',
        url  => 'https://github.com/oalders/git-helpers.git',
        web  => 'https://github.com/oalders/git-helpers',
    }

This is essentially the data structure which is returned by the MetaCPAN API,
so it *could* change if/when the MetaCPAN API changes output formats.

This method returns C<undef> if the release was found but does not provide any
repository information.  It will C<die> if the release cannot be found via the
MetaCPAN API.
